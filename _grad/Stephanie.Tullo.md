Stephanie joined the CoBrA lab in May 2015 as an undergraduate student in Neuroscience. She is currently a MSc candidate in the Integrated Program in Neuroscience (IPN) at McGill University. Her research interests include the influence of various factors such as environmental influences or genetic factors on brain structure and behaviour, as well as the cytopathology of neurodegenerative disorders and its effects on brain anatomy using neuroimaging techniques. She is currently working on an atlas of the basal ganglia and thalamus, as well as other subcortical structures, to explore the effects of healthy aging on these structures, and to study the implications of these structures in Parkinson's disease and other mental illnesses.
