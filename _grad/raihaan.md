Hello, my name is Raihaan Patel.

I joined the Cobra Lab during the summer of 2014 as a Research Assistant.  As part of the Cobra Lab, I use computational techniques to investigate anatomical features and changes within the brain.  My work centers around automatic segmentation using the MAGeT Brain technique.

Before joining the Cobra Lab, I completed my BASc in Engineering Science at the University of Toronto.  In the near future, I plan to begin a Master's degree at McGill University in Biomedical Engineering.  During this time, I will further investigate the effectiveness of computational techniques, and use them to track the effects of anatomical changes in the brain.


Outside of the lab, I enjoy running, shooting some hoops and eating delicious food.
