        The Computational Brain Anatomy (CoBrA) Laboratory is located at the Cerebral Imaging Centre at the Douglas Mental Health University Institute (Verdun, QC, Canada; affiliated with McGill University).
        Our laboratory is interested the anatomy of the brain and how it matures through adolescence, how it stays healthy through the normal ageing process, and how alterations in brain anatomy are related to neurodegenerative   disorders such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease and neurodevelopmental disorders such as schizophrenia.
To do so, we use and develop sophisticated computation neuroanatomy techniques that are able to automatically parse the geomtric complexity of brain anatomy.
        Our group is a multi-disciplinary group of neuroscientists, computer scientists, engineers, and physicists all working towards a common goal of improving our understanding of the structure-function relationships of the brain through health and illness.
        We publicly disseminate much of the algorithmic and atlas work that we do in an effort to promote open and reproducible science.
