I joined the CoBrA Lab in January 2015 as a Research Assistant. I completed my undergrad at McGill in psychology, and am interested in studying brain anatomy and changes in neuropsychiatric disorders, in particular autism and schizophrenia. I am currently working on the Healthy Aging study, looking at the effects of normal and healthy aging on hippocampal subfield anatomy, and will also be involved in an upcoming comparison study of individuals at high risk for psychosis. 

Outside of the lab, I love running, cycling, travelling, coffee and chocolate.
