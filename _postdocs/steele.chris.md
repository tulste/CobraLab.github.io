Chris started his post-doc in the lab in September of 2015. He is interested in diffusion, motor learning, segmentation, and classification - and is spending most of his time at the lab developing methods to parcellate white-matter tracts with targeted tractography. He is currently exploring how diffusion metrics and white-matter connectional anatomy can be used to quantify and define the lobules of the human cerebellum - with applications in neurological disease, assessing population variability, and heritability.

Chris received his PhD an MA in Psychology at Concordia University, Montreal, under the supervision of Dr. Virginia Penhune. His graduate investigated the behavioural, structural, and functional correlates of learning and expert performance in young adults. He recently completed a post-doctoral fellowship with Dr. Arno Villringer and Patrick Ragert in the Motor Plasticity lab at the Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences in Leipzig (MPI-CBS) where he continued his work on human skill learning and white-matter connectional anatomy - with a focus on intrinsic cerebellar connectivity.

Oh, and Chris also has a side gig at the Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences (Leipzig, Germany)  where he spends his time complaining about the weather and quantifying training-related motor plasticity in healthy adults.
