For decades, neuroscientific research has simply described the cerebellum as being a region that is involved in the regulation of motor function.
However, emerging research suggests that the cerebellum is far more active in brain networks that are related to cognition and other brain functions.
Our goal is to better understand the anatomy of the cerebellum  (Park et al., 2014) and how alterations in healthy development of this understudied brain area may be implicated in different neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism and schizophrenia and neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease (see also: [atlases](/atlastes)).
