Christine is a biomedical engineer and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) physicist. She joined the CoBrA lab as a postdoc in 2015.

Her expertise is in quantitative and high-resolution structural MRI of the brain. During her PhD at the Montreal Neurological Institute (McGill University, Canada), she developed new imaging techniques to study cortical pathology in multiple sclerosis, which is notoriously difficult to detect using conventional MRI. She then moved to Leipzig, Germany, to further her research on cortical myeloarchitecture using ultra-high-field MRI (7 T). At the Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences, she developed novel image analysis tools that are being used to investigate the microstructural changes that occur during learning-induced plasticity.

At the CoBrA lab, her work focuses on the development of MRI biomarkers for the early (presymptomatic) phases of disease by combining advanced morphological and microstructural imaging. These projects are performed in collaboration with several research groups at the Douglas Institute, including the Prevent-AD Centre.
