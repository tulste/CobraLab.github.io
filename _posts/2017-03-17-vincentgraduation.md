The CoBrA lab would like to congratulate Vincent on graduating with a degree of M.Sc. in Neuroscience from the Integrated Program in Neuroscience from McGill University!

Vincent completed his master's thesis entitled "Longitudinal Neuroanatomical and Behavioural Characterization of a Triple Transgenic Mouse Model of Alzheimer's Disease" in February, and will be attending his convocation ceremony in June. During his time at the lab, Vincent contributed to the initiation and development of the animal portion of the lab in terms of procedures, protocols, and animal care and husbandry. He is currently looking for opportunities where he can continue to find new things that to fill his curiosity for neuroscience and the workings of the human body.

The CoBrA lab would like to wish Vincent the best of luck in his future endeavours!
