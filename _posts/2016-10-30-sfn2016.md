title: We are going to SfN's 2016 Conference!
---

The CoBrA Lab will be at the Society for Neuroscience’s annual meeting in San Diego from November 12-16. This event is the world’s largest meeting in neuroscience, with over 30,000 attendees from around the globe, and allows scientists to present their findings, learn from experts, forge collaborations, and explore new tools and technologies. Two of our lab members (Daniel Gallino and Gulebru Ayranci) will be presenting posters and three of them (Elisa Guma, Christine Tardif, and Chris Steele) will be presenting their research with a nanosymposium.
