title: Congratulations to Stephanie on receiving a NSERC Canada Graduate Scholarship!
---

M.Sc. student Stephanie Tullo was awarded the Alexander Graham Bell Canada Graduate Scholarship from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC). The objective of the Canada Graduate Scholarships is to help develop research skills and assist in the training of highly qualified personnel by supporting students who demonstrate a high standard of achievement in undergraduate and early graduate studies. With the support of this award, Stephanie will investigate the relationship between age and motor performance (previously demonstrated to be of importance in the study of movement disorders) on subcortical morphology across the adult lifespan by improving MAGeTbrain to improve the identification of the basal ganglia and thalamus through the development of improved input atlases.
