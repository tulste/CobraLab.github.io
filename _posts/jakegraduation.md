---

The CoBrA lab would like to congratulate Jake on graduating with a degree of M.Sc.in Neuroscience from the Integrated Program in Neuroscience from McGill University! 

During his time at the CoBrA lab, Jake completed his master's in Neuroscience at McGill University, with supervisors Dr. Mallar Chakravarty and Dr. Martin Lepage, where he investigated the neuroimaging and genetic correlates of persistent negative symptoms in first-episode psychosis; this work will soon be published in the Journal of Psychiatry & Neuroscience, and is in review at Schizophrenia Research.

Outside of the lab, Jake is a semi-professional musician who has arranged, conducted, recorded and produced music in numerous styles for varying media. He is the coÂ­founder and assistant director of PopTones Vocal Ensemble, and has recently released his first collection of solo music, entitled EVOLVE. 

Jake is currently pursuing his Ph.D. in clinical psychology at Concordia University under the supervision of Dr. Virginia Penhune. For more about Jake, visit jshenker.com.

The CoBrA lab would like to wish Jake the best of luck in his future endeavours!
