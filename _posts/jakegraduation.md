recently completed his Masters in Neuroscience at McGill University, with supervisors Dr. Mallar Chakravarty and Dr. Martin Lepage. His work involved the study of neuroimaging genetics within a sample of first-episode psychosis individuals with specific interest in persistent negative symptoms in individuals with schizophrenia, and hoped to identify genes and anatomical changes which to help understand this phenomenon.


Jake Shenker recently completed his MSc in neuroscience at McGill University, where he investigated the neuroimaging and genetic correlates of persistent negative symptoms in first-episode psychosis; this work will soon be published in the Journal of Psychiatry & Neuroscience, and is in review at Schizophrenia Research. 

Jake is currently pursuing his Ph.D. in clinical psychology at Concordia University under the supervision of Dr. Virginia Penhune. For more about Jake, visit jshenker.com.
