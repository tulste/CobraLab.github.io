recently completed his Masters in Neuroscience at McGill University, with supervisors Dr. Mallar Chakravarty and Dr. Martin Lepage. His work involved the study of neuroimaging genetics within a sample of first-episode psychosis individuals with specific interest in persistent negative symptoms in individuals with schizophrenia, and hoped to identify genes and anatomical changes which to help understand this phenomenon.

Jake is currently pursuing a Ph.D. in clinical psychology at Concordia University.
