title: Congratulations to Saashi on graduating from the IPN program with a M.Sc. in Neuroscience!
---

The CoBrA lab would like to congratulate Saashi on graduating with a degree of M.Sc. in Neuroscience from the Integrated Program in Neuroscience from McGill University!

Saashi completed her master's thesis entitled "Large-scale analysis of heterogeneity and cortical thickness in autism spectrum disorder" in December. For her Master's, Saashi aimed to address the heterogeneity in autism spectrum disorder by performing a large-scale examination of alterations in cortical thickness, with a specific focus on sex differences, using a large, multi-site structural magnetic resonance imaging dataset and state-of-the-art computational and statistical analysis techniques. To learn more about her project and the results obtained, be on the lookout for her paper in which she is in the process of submitting for publication. 

While Saashi is currently in the lab working as an RA at the CoBrA Lab, she is hoping to start her PhD in clinical psychology at McGill University in September 2018. The CoBrA lab wishes her the best of luck in her future endeavours!
