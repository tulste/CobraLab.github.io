On Wednesday, January 31, Canadians everywhere will talk, text, and tweet as part of Bell Canada's annual Bell Let's Talk Day initiative designed to fight stigma surrounding mental illness and raise funds for mental health in Canada. 

To raise awareness about Bell Let's Talk Day and promote the open discussion of mental health, Dr. Mallar Chakravarty was invited to talk with CTV's Mutsumi Takahashi about the stigma of mental illness and the challenges individuals of cultural communities face in seeking and receiving mental health services. 

Check out the video below for interview on CTV Montreal News.
