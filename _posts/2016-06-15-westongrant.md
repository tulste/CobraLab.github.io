title: Weston Brain Institute Funding for Alzheimer's disease Biomarkers Research
---

Our lab leader Dr. Mallar Chakravarty was granted funding from the Weston Brain Institute's Rapid Response program to support our laboratory's new exciting work investigating MR imaging and genetic-based biomarkers to identify risk for Alzheimer's disease.
