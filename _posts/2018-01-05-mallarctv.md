title: A Non-Invasive Method to Detect Alzheimerâ€™s Disease
---

Research from our group has shown a link between MRI-based hippocampal volume estimates and biomarkers found in patients years before cognitive decline. Specifically, a recent paper from our group, [Tardif et al. (2017)](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hbm.23897/full) suggest that hippocampal subfield volume and extra-hippocampal white matter microstructure demonstrate a complex pattern where an initial volume increase is followed by decline among asymptomatic individuals who, in some instances, may be a decade or more away from onset of cognitive or functional impairment associated with Alzherimer's disease.
