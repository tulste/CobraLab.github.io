title: Camp Cobra 2016!
---

The Cobra Lab recently descended upon Kamp Kanawana in Saint-Sauveur for its second annual lab retreat. We spent the two days reviewing our accomplishments of the past year as well as brainstorming future directions for research. It was not all business however; there was plenty of time for tomfoolery and ballyhoo. We canoed and kayaked, played games around the campfire and of course, ate smores. The weather was unseasonably warm which made jumping (read falling) into the lake all the more enjoyable!
