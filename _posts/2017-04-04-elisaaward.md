title: Congratulations to Elisa on receiving a W.G. DEWHURST Travel Award!
---

Ph.D. student Elisa Guma recently won a W.G. DEWHURST Travel Award to attend the Annual Canadian College of Neuropsychopharmacology Meeting which will be held in Kingston, Ontario from June 7th to 9th. At the conference, she will present her research investigating how the timing of maternal immune activation (a known risk factor for neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism and schizophrenia) affects neuroanatomical and behavioural outcomes in the offspring. If you happen to be at the ACCN meeting, check out her abstract entitled "Neuroanatomical and Behavioural Differences in Models of Neurodevelopmental disorders: An Examination of Offspring Exposed to Maternal Immune Activation in Early and Late Gestation".
