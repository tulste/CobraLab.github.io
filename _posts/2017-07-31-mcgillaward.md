title: Congratulations to Elisa and Raihaan on each receiving the Shuk-Tak Liang Fellowship!
---

Ph.D. students Elisa Guma and Raihaan Patel were each awarded a Faculty of Medicine Internal Studentship Award from McGill University. They both received the Shuk-Tak Liang Fellowship, in which is offered to highly qualified graduate students. 

With the support of this award, Raihaan will be investigating normative patterns of microstructure and function of the human hippocampus using multi modal MRI data. Elisa, who will retain her FRQS award (and as a result had to decline this award), is investigating how the timing of maternal immune activation (a known risk factor for neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism and schizophrenia) affects neuroanatomical and behavioural outcomes in the offspring.
