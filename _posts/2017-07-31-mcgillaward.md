title: Congratulations to Elisa and Raihaan on each receiving the Shuk-Tak Liang Fellowship!
---

Ph.D. students Elisa Guma and Raihaan Patel were both awarded a Faculty of Medicine Internal Studentship Award from McGill University. Elisa and Raihaan both received the Shuk-Tak Liang Fellowship. This award is offered to highly qualified Faculty of Medicine graduate students. 

With the support of this award, Elisa will be investigating how the timing of maternal immune activation (a known risk factor for neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism and schizophrenia) affects neuroanatomical and behavioural outcomes in the offspring, and Raihaan will be investigating normative patterns of microstructure and function of the human hippocampus using multi modal MRI data.
