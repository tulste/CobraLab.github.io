title: New Hippocampal White Matter Atlas!
---

Check out our recently developed hippocampal white matter atlas created by Roberto Amaral. This atlas provides segmentation of the white matter tracts of the hippocampus (alveus, fimbria, and fornix), derived from a reliable protocol for manual segmentation of these hippocampal white matter regions using high-resolution magnetic resonance images. Moreover, this atlas can be used in complement with the [hippocampal subfield atlas](http://cobralab.ca/atlases/Hippocampus-subfields/) previously developed in our lab. For more information about this atlas, check out our atlases [webpage](http://cobralab.ca/atlases/) or to download it, click [here](https://github.com/CobraLab/atlases).

Furthermore, this atlas was used to analyze the trajectory of these hippocampal white matter regions in both healthy aging (OASIS), Alzheimerâ€™s disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) using ADNI. For more information about the methods and results used to map the human memory circuit white and grey matter in healthy and pathological aging, check out the pre-print version of the [article]({{ site.baseurl }}/preprints/Amaral_hippocampus_whitematter_2016.pdf).
