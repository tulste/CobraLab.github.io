The CoBrA lab would like to congratulate Colleen on receiving the Gates Cambridge Scholarship. This scholarship funds international students from outside the UK to pursue a post-graduate degree at the University of Cambridge. With this scholarship, Colleen will be completing a PhD in Psychiatry under the supervision of Dr. John Suckling, co-director of the Brain Mapping Unit. Her research aim is to use a multimodal approach integrating brain structural and functional data and cognitive measures to develop a neurobiological model for the manifestation of hallucinations in patients with schizophrenia.
