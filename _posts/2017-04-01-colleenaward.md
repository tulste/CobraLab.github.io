Gates Cambridge Scholarship, it funds international students from outside the UK to pursue a post-graduate degree at the University of Cambridge. Don't recall the exact date, but I was awarded it in early April. Not sure what you want to include, but you can see details about it here: https://www.gatescambridge.org/
