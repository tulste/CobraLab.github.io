The CoBrA lab would like to congratulate fellow member Anthony Chen on winning the best poster presentation at the Douglas Institute Research Center's Undergraduate Research Expo. Anthony presented his work titled, "Learning the whole from understanding its parts: In Vivo, Multimodal Parcellation of the Thalamus". His project explores a de novo, multimodal, data-driven method of detecting patterns of microstructural covariance in the human thalamus.  Anthony tied for first place with fellow undergraudate student Tara Delorme. Congratulations to the winners, and to all students who presented!
